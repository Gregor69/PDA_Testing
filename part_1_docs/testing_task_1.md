### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


# In the function below there should be another equal sign, so card.value == 1. Also needs to be a colon after else - so else:
  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    else
      return False
   
#  The first line should start 'def', not 'dif' and there should be a comma between card1 and card2. In the third line it should read 'return card1'.
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  
# In the function below the first line it should say 'def get_cards_total'. In the second line it should say 'total = 0'. Third line should read 'for card in self.cards'. Last line should be lined up with third line.

def cards_total(self, cards):
  total = 
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
